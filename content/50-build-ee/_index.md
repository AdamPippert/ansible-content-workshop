## Build an execution environment

Execution environments are Linux container images which are built on top of the [Red Hat Universal Base Images](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introducing-red-hat-universal-base-image) (UBI) and additionally contain:

* ansible-core

* Python and its dependencies

* Ansible collections and their dependencies

* optionally additional software packages like RPMs

This makes the execution of an ansible playbook more scalable, reliable and predictable since the combination of Playbook and execution environment should always deliver the same results.

### Prerequisites

* Install `ansible-builder`: on RHEL this is provided by the AAP repo, on Fedora you will need `pip install ansible-builder`, itâ€™s recommended to use a virtual environment in this case.

```bash
# Only if you're not on RHEL
dnf -y install python3-virtualenv
virtualenv ansible-builder
. ansible-builder/bin/activate
pip install -U pip ansible-builder
# If you are on RHEL and the AAP repo is enabled
sudo yum install ansible-builder
```

### Tasks

#### Checkout repo

Clone the repo to your VS Code terminal

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ansible-learnfest/ee-flow.git
```

#### Login to registry.redhat.io

```bash
podman login registry.redhat.io
```

#### Build Execution Environment

* In the repo change to the `ansible-builder` directory

* Run `ansible-builder` to create the new EE as in the example below:

```bash
cd ee-flow/ansible-builder/
ansible-builder build -f ee-ansible-demo.yml -t ee-ansible-demo:0.1.0 -v 3
```

{{% notice note %}}
We're using the `-v 3` flags to get more detailed output from `ansible-builder` - by default the tool is very quiet.

* Experiment with the other options, e.g. adding an RPM or Python package

#### Use the Execution Environment

* Configure `ansible-navigator` to use the previously created EE either by specifying it on the command line or by creating an `ansible-navigator.yml` configuration file. You can set a specific EE on the command line with the '--eei &lt;image&gt;' flag.

Or if you prefer to make the necessary changes in the `~/.ansible-navigator.yaml` add the following section:

```yaml
---
ansible-navigator:
  execution-environment:
    image: ah.bolzchristian.de/ee-cjung-standard:latest
```

* Inspect your EE by using `ansible-navigator`, e.g. to get the list of included collections, ansible versions etc.

* Write and run a playbook using the `containers.podman` to create containers or use the previously used example part of the [ee-flow](https://github.com/ansible-learnfest/ee-flow.git) project.

{{% notice note %}}
In a production environment we typically recommend to use the `ee-minimal-rhel8` as a base image and only add the collections we specifically need. To make this lab not too complex, we decided to use the EE supported as a base image though.

### Goals

* Build an EE adding at least one collection

* Use your execution environment to create a container.
