## Transfer your EE

### Prerequisites

* a working execution environment
* private automation hub to store your EE

### Tasks

* Publish your EE to your private automation hub
* Add additional tags or labels and push them to the registry
* Experiment with other registries, e.g. Quay (make sure to either delete your EE after you're done or make sure itâ€™s not publicly accessible since the EE supported requires a subscription!)
* Delete old versions of the EE

### Goal

* Publish an EE in your own registry
* Get familiar with basic EE management tasks

### Tips

* [Skopeo documentation](https://github.com/containers/skopeo)
* [Podman documentation](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/)
