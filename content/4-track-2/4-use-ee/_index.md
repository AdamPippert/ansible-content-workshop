## Task 4: Use the EE in controller

**Prerequisites**

**Tasks**

* Configure the controller to pull the EE from automation hub
* Create a job template using the EE
* Test a playbook with the collection you added to the EE, e.g. perform an action in Azure

Challenge tasks:

* Build another EE with different content, import it into Controller and use different job templates with different EE’s
* Think about version pinning in the EE: what’s the best way to do it? How can you track versioning?
* If you use GitLab or GitHub have a look at _renovate_ which can help you to track dependencies. [https://docs.renovatebot.com/](https://docs.renovatebot.com/)
