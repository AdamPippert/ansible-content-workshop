## Task 1: Learn about the VSCode extension 

We highly recommend making yourself familiar with VSCode and the Ansible extension. Even if youâ€™re not planning to use it as your daily driver, it is good to know how it works to explain and show the benefit to customers.

**Prerequisites**


**Tasks**

* Install VSCode [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 
* Install the Ansible extension: [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.ansible](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.ansible) 
* Install ansible-navigator
* Configure the VSCode extension to use EE
* Create a playbook/role/collection
* Get familiar with the VSCode extension features
    * tab completion
    * syntax highlighting
    * tool tips for modules: hover over and FQCN, Ctrl+Click on an FQCN to open documentation
    * Ctrl+Space for module parameters, e.g. add a task calling ansible.builtin.yum and use Ctrl+Space to see all module attributes and attribute parameters
    * Make syntax error and notice errors in the Problem pane (Ctrl+m): you might have to make sure ansible-lint is enabled and notice it is only checking when you save a file
