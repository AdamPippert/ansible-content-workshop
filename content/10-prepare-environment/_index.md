## Setup your LearnFest Environment

For the Ansible LearnFest we use the [AAP2 Linux Automation Workshop](https://rhpds.redhat.com/catalog/explorer) from RHPDS. If you run this workshop during Red Hat Tech Exchange, a lab was already created and details will be provided to you.

If you provision or order your own lab, make sure you enable the private automation hub.
