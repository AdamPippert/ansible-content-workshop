# Ansible LearnFest Guide

## What is it about

The **Ansible LearnFest** is a format we created because we felt there is a gap between the enablement and training offerings from Red Hat (workshops, guided labs, official trainings) and "real" hackathons with an open agenda. We wanted a format where the student gets tasks, goals and hints to help install and configure all the components of Ansible Automation Platform like Automation Controller, Private Automation Hub, Automation Mesh, Clustering, Automation Service Catalog etc him/herself.

This guide will lead you through exactly this: installing, configuring and using Ansible Automation Platform. But this is not your usual lab guide where you can follow along without a lot of thought; this is not supposed to be a fully scripted lab or workshop but a guided learning experience where you will get real hands-on experience by running all steps yourself.
