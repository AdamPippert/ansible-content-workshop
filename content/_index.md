# Ansible LearnFest Guide

## What is the Ansible LearnFest?

The **Ansible LearnFest** is a format we created because we felt there is a gap between the enablement and training offerings from Red Hat (workshops, guided labs, official trainings) and "real" hackathons with an open agenda. Our goal here is to create a format where instead of detailed step-by-step instructions the student gets tasks, goals and hints to help install and configure the components of Ansible Automation Platform him/herself.

This guide will lead you through exactly this: installing, configuring and using Ansible Automation Platform. But this is not your usual lab guide where you can follow along without a lot of thought; this is not supposed to be a fully scripted lab or workshop but a guided learning experience where you will get real hands-on experience by running all steps yourself.

The LearnFest can be tailored to available time and focus areas, it can be a full-blown AAP experience starting from installing and configuring everything or focus on getting familiar with dedicated AAP components.

## Collaboration
The Ansible LearnFest and this guide was created by Goetz Rieger and Christian Jung.
