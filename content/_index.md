# Ansible LearnFest Guide

## What is it about
This guide will lead you through installing, configuring and using Ansible Automation Platform. The format was called LearnFest by us because this is not supposed to be a fully scripted lab or workshop but a guided learning experience where you will get real hands-on experience by running all steps yourself.

This guide will give you tasks to set up a fully-fledged AAP environment together with some tipps and tricks to get you started and keep you going.
